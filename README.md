# Endless Wordle

My attempt to recreate the [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/) game. This is mostly for my own coding practice

## Task list

- [x] implementation of a wordle game
- [x] implementation difficulty
- [x] styling

## Running Locally

```sh
npm ci
npm run build
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
```

This will start a server on port `8080`, on which you can play the game

## Testing

```sh
npm test
```
